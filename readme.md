## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download and install all the dependencies.

You need a PostgreSQL database, if you already have one, you can put your credentials in the .env file in the DB\_... section. If you do not have one, you can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/). The docker-compose.yml is given in the root directory.

### Installing

To get a development env running, install all the dependencies with:

```cmd
composer install && npm install
```

Don't forget to edit your .env file. If you do not have one:

```cmd
cp .env.example .env
```

And modify your credentials.
Then generate your jwt key and your app key

```cmd
php artisan key:generate
php artisan jwt:secret
```

If you don't have a PostgreSQL you can start the docker-compose.yml file is included up in the root directory

```cmd
docker-compose up
```

To start your PHP server use the command (_by default the server will start on localhost:8000_):

```cmd
php artisan serve
```

You can specify a port by using

```cmd
php artisan serve --port=8080
```

Or you can simply run the launchscript.sh with:

```cmd
./launchscript.sh
```

If it doesn't work, it probably means you have to set the right to execute it.

```cmd
sudo chmod +x launchscript.sh
```

## DB

### Init

`php artisan migrate`

### Reset

`php artisan migrate:fresh`

## Deployment

The project is ready to deploy on heroku, just push this repo to your herokuapp repository.
Add you addon for the database with the following :

```cmd
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Don't forget to edit the configs with:

-   APP_ENV = production
-   APP_KEY
-   APP_URL = your url
-   DB_CONNECTION = heroku
-   JWT_SECRET
-   MAIL_PASSWORD
-   MAIL_USERNAME

And finally run in the console of your heroku app:

```cmd
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

to set your database
